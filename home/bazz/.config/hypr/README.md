# Hyprland confics

- If you wan't to mimic this setup on Void please read install guide from: https://github.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void

- Stability on Void is not 100% guaranteed since Void Linux maintainers do not like or support Hyprland. Use something like Arch if you want proper support.

#### Todo to myself:

- [ ] Maybe replace swayidle with hypridle?
- [ ] Maybe setup hyprcursor??
- [ ] Maybe replace seatd with elogind if you go hypridle???
- [ ] Maybe use supported system like Arch?
