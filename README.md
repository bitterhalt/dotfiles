# Dotfiles

My point was to get light weight system without useless annoyances.
I don't use fancy desktop shell's like AGS because I wan't my system to be fast and responsive.

I have used two window managers: **Sway** and **Hyprland** Both have a similar workflow. I currently use Sway because it is lighter and offers a more stable user experience, while Hyprland is more of a test platform.
