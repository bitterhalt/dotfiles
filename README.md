## Dotfiles

> **Hello friend!**
>
> These are the dotfiles of my keyboard-driven environment. I prefer fuction over eyecandy so I'm trying to keep thinks pretty minimal. At the moment I use Hyprland as my main WM and Sway is there for backup
>
> At the moment, Sway uses Waybar and shell scripts instead of ignis, but this might change in future

### Installation

> ⚠️ Installation script is still WIP, so please be careful. I don't recommend blindly copying the entire repository, but rather taking bits and pieces from here and there.

```bash
bash <(curl -L https://github.com/bitterhalt/dotfiles/blob/main/.assets/curl.sh)
```

> Note: atm, you can get my ignis shell and componens [here](https://github.com/bitterhalt/comfy-shell)
>
> After main installation scrip clone my ignis repo and move ignis directory ~/.config/

```bash
ignis init -c ~/.config/ignis/config.py
```
